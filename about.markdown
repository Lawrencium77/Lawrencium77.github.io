Hello! <br>
I'm Lawrence, a Machine Learning Engineer at Speechmatics. My work is mostly concerned with training and optimising large-scale transformers. This blogs on this site are designed to help other engineers who come across similar problems to us. If you have enjoyed these blogs, or have any feedback, I'd love to hear it!
