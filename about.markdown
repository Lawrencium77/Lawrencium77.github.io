Hi! My name is Lawrence. I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Speechmatics](https://www.speechmatics.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=%7Bspeechmaticsbranded%7D&ad_group=126556305012&match_type=e&device=c&keyword=speechmatics&utm_term=speechmatics&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwm4ukBhAuEiwA0zQxk83Q101NFOEV5JTVC0eVs6LYwOoEjkRy6IAlCEgavQaNrbud3Hj-dhoCRckQAvD_BwE) where I work on self-supervised learning for audio.

Engineering neural networks is hard. This website documents some interesting things I've learnt, in the hope that it can be useful to others. 

If you have any feedback, I'd love to hear it! Feel free to reach out via email, or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawrence-atkins/).
