Hello! <br>
I'm Lawrence - a Machine Learning Engineer at speech tech startup [Speechmatics](https://www.speechmatics.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=%7Bspeechmaticsbranded%7D&ad_group=126556305012&match_type=e&device=c&keyword=speechmatics&utm_term=speechmatics&gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw9deiBhC1ARIsAHLjR2DlWvhb1yTLpA3672_vB7sTe4gLdTlr-HfmKya0QCppZOQ9IYtdwo4aAktbEALw_wcB). My work is mostly concerned with training and optimising large-scale transformers. These blogs are intended to help other engineers. If you have any feedback, I'd love to hear it!
